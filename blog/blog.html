    <p id="fashion">The  fashion industry in  Kenya has grown tremendously over the last decade and several top fashion bloggers in Kenya have been steering the growth.  
        From numerous clothe lines being launched to tens of fashion galas being held annually and hundreds of professionals in the fashion world coming out 
         to proclaim there is indeed a lucrative career in the sector, the industry has seen its fair share of progress.  
        However, not as much as I expected especially in the internet space. With more people growing passionate about fashion and others building careers, 
        I was looking forward to seeing an array of fashion influencers taking up blogging to expand their reach and provide quality content from their 
        experience online.   
        My research on Fashion bloggers in Kenya led me to discover the huge gap of content that exist despite the insatiable thirst of quality content 
        that Kenyan fashion enthusiasts have.  
        Social media is awash with self-proclaimed influencers and socialites taking pictures in cool places while clad fashionably but 90% of these  
        people know nothing about fashion.  
        Kenya has very few successful fashion bloggers
